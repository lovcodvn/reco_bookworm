# Group Project _ Recommender System

For illustration, this is our demo : https://bookwormrecomm.herokuapp.com/ 
To understand how the recommendations are selected, please read the descriptions below.

## Overview
The recommendation results are subject to the three following inputs. Users can key in any one or all of them.
1. User id
2. Book Genre
3. Book Title

The results are generated by different models, depending on what inputs users provide. The default number of recommended books is 100 and reduces when more inputs are available

## Recommendations based on user id 
We use collaborative deep learning (CDL), which joinly perform deep representation learning for content information (book description) and collaborative filtering for the ratings matrix (user-book-rating). 

By using rating matrix, the model learns similar users based on users' preferences to books. In addition, the model uses auxiliary information - books' descriptions - to learn books' vectors. This combination of the two components from two different sources improves the model performance significantly. 

## Recommending books based book similarity 
With an assumption that users will like the books that are similar to the books that they liked, when a book title are input, the recommender system will find similar books to make recommendation.
To determine book similarity, the books's latent factors generated by CDL model are used with cosine similarity.
