# Group Project _ Recommender System

For illustration, this is our demo : https://bookwormrecomm.herokuapp.com/ 
To understand how the recommendations are selected, please read the descriptions below.

## Overview
The recommendation results are subject to the three following inputs. Users can key in any one or all of them.
1. User id
2. Book Genre
3. Book Title

The results are generated by different models, depending on what inputs users provide. The default number of recommended books is 100 and reduces when more inputs are available

## Recommendations based on user id (Collaborative Filtering)
We use collaborative deep learning (CDL), which joinly perform deep representation learning for content information (book description) and collaborative filtering for the ratings matrix (user-book-rating). 

By using rating matrix, the model learn users' preferences and similar users. In addition, the model uses auxiliary information - books' descriptions - to learn books' vectors. This combination of the two components from two different sources improve the model performance significantly.
