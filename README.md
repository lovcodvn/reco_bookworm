## Overview
The recommendations are subject to the three following inputs. Users can key in only one or all of them.
1. User id
2. Book Genre
3. Book Title

The recommendations are generated by different models, depending on what inputs users provide. The default number of recommended books is 100 and reduces when more inputs are available
